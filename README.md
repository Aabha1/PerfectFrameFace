This is the first part of the project where the task of face recognisation is performed.
You can choose the images from sample provided or you can even choose any image of your choice.
The image should contain 1 person only.
The age and gender of the person is recognized and on submitting the image, the page is directed to the next part of the project which will display the selected products on the website.

If you have downloaded the source file and want to run it. Please run it in a live server and do not use Node.js since this file does not contain @tensorflow.js/tfjs-node. The problem on installing it was my system. This file is not installing on win-32/ia32(the system i am using).

The models folder and face-api.min.js are pre-bliut folder and library which I am using to bluid-up this prototype. The image is downloaded from unsplash and stored here. The rest of the files are bluid in by me as a part of the project.

Thank you for reading.
